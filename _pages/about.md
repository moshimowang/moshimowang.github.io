**Interests**: Machine learning and statistical learning theory, multiclass and multi-label classification, learning from noisy labels, non-decomposable performance measures, and applications of machine learning. I enjoy developing both theory and algorithms to solve problems of practical import.<br>
**Methodologies**:  Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization.
