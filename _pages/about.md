<!--- My Chinese name: 张明远.<br> -->
I am a PhD candidate working in Machine Learning with Associate Professor [Shivani Agarwal](https://www.shivani-agarwal.net) in the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu). Before joining Penn, I received B.S. degree at [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) in 2018 with four majors: (Honors) Mathematics, (Honors) Statistics, Computer Science and Data Science.

Research Interests and Methodologies
======
**Interests**: Machine learning and statistical learning theory, multiclass and multi-label classification, learning from noisy labels, non-decomposable performance measures. I enjoy developing both theory and algorithms to solve problems of practical import.<br>
**Methodologies**:  Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization.
