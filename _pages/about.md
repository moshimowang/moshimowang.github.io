I am a PhD student researcher focusing on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, having the honor to be advised by <a href="https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/shivani-agarwal/" target="_blank">Prof. Shivani Agarwal</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. Before joining Penn, I received B.S. degree at University of Michigan in 2018 with four majors: (Honors) Mathematics, (Honors) Statistics, Computer Science and Data Science.

Research Interests and Methodologies
======
**Interests**: Machine learning and statistical learning theory, multiclass and multi-label classification, learning from noisy labels, non-decomposable performance measures, and applications of machine learning. I enjoy developing both theory and algorithms to solve problems of practical import.<br>
**Methodologies**:  Probability, Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization.
